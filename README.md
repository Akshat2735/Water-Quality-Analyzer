# Water Quality Monitoring System

An Arduino-based **Water Quality Monitoring System** that measures **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), Conductivity, Salinity, and Temperature** to determine if water is drinkable.

## 📜 Features
- **TDS Measurement**: Evaluates water purity.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Reads water temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.
- **Salinity & Conductivity**: Estimates water properties.
- **Drinking Water Status**: Classifies water as drinkable or non-drinkable.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Board** (Uno, Mega, etc.)
- **TDS Sensor**
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**
- **Resistors and Connecting Wires**
- **Power Supply**
